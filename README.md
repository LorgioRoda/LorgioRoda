## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
###  **Hi there! I am Lorgio Roda. An enthusiast programmer. Frontend Developer with Node.js, Vue.js and React.js as my tech stack.** 
#### Born in Bolivia, I decided to leave my comfort zone and move to Spain, Barcelona. I was lucky to collaborate and work with very good teams, where I have developed and improved my technical and soft skills.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I finished my studies for Iron Hack. I would wake up at 2 am every day during the three months I attended, because I lived in Bolivia, and the bootcamp was in Barcelona.
